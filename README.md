# Final project for ECE 419

The original vision for this project was a survey of local businesses' public networks to determine how secure the average public network was. After we created an initial plan and approach a couple of businesses, we received lukewarm responses. Most businesses didn't want us interferring with their network, or didn't have time to work with us.

As a result, we decided to pivot and focus on applying our research to a simple introduction and guide to basic network security. Run from a Juypter notebook, the guide contains both text descriptions as well as python scripts to guide the user through some tips and tricks to improve their nextwork security.
